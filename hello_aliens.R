cat("Hello Friends!
  
  Hope you are doing well. My name is Roma and I live on Earth.
  I would love to know a little more about you and tell you about my people as well. 
  What do you call yourselves? We can ourselves humans or homo sapiens. Everyone is unique
  and different. People come from different backgrounds, races, religions, and cultures.
  What is your planet called? Like I said, our planet is called Earth.
  Do you enjoy living there? I enjoy living on Earth, but I think it would be cool to visit Mars.
  Have you ever been to Mars? (Or are you from Mars?) I think there's a lot of cool
  places to visit on Earth, but haven't seen much of the world. Maybe one day I will be able
  to travel all across Earth. How did you find this letter? Hope you found it easily.
  What type of food do you eat? I love to eat pizza and bagels.

  Ok, that's enough for now. Hope you learned something about me and my planet.
  Would love to hear back from you (if I'm still alive).
  You can find me at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA 
  or call me at (973) 862-1809. 
    
  Safe travels.")
